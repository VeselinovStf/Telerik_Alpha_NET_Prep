Exercises: Defining Classes

This document defines the exercise assignments for the "CSharp OOP Basics" course @ Software University.
Please submit your solutions (source code) of all below described problems in Judge.
Define a Class Person
Define a class Person with private fields for name and age and public properties Name and Age.
Bonus*
Try to create a few objects of type Person:
Name	Age
Pesho	20
Gosho	18
Stamat	43

Use both the inline initialization and the default constructor.
Creating Constructors

Add 3 constructors to the Person class from the last task, use constructor chaining to reuse code:
The first should take no arguments and produce a person with name “No name” and age = 1. 
The second should accept only an integer number for the age and produce a person with name “No name” and age equal to the passed parameter.
The third one should accept a string for the name and an integer for the age and should produce a person with the given name and age.
Oldest Family Member
Use your Person class from the previous tasks. Create a class Family. The class should have list of people, a method for adding members (void AddMember(Person member)) and a method returning the oldest family member (Person GetOldestMember()). Write a program that reads the names and ages of N people and adds them to the family. Then print the name and age of the oldest member.

Company Roster
Define a class Employee that holds the following information: name, salary, position, department, email and age. The name, salary, position and department are mandatory while the rest are optional. 
Your task is to write a program which takes N lines of employees from the console and calculates the department with the highest average salary and prints for each employee in that department his name, salary, email and age – sorted by salary in descending order. If an employee doesn’t have an email – in place of that field you should print “n/a” instead, if he doesn’t have an age – print “-1” instead. The salary should be printed to two decimal places after the seperator.

Speed Racing
Your task is to implement a program that keeps track of cars and their fuel and supports methods for moving the cars. Define a class Car that keeps track of a car’s model, fuel amount, fuel consumption for 1 kilometer and distance traveled. A Car’s model is unique - there will never be 2 cars with the same model.
 On the first line of the input you will receive a number N – the number of cars you need to track, on each of the next N lines you will receive information for a car in the following format “<Model> <FuelAmount> <FuelConsumptionFor1km>”. All cars start at 0 kilometers traveled.
After the N lines, until the command “End” is received, you will receive commands in the following format “Drive <CarModel>  <amountOfKm>”. Implement a method in the Car class to calculate whether or not a car can move that distance. If it can, the car’s fuel amount should be reduced by the amount of used fuel and its distance traveled should be increased by the number of kilometers traveled. Otherwise, the car should not move (its fuel amount and distance traveled should stay the same) and you should print on the console “Insufficient fuel for the drive”. After the “End” command is received, print each car and its current fuel amount and distance traveled in the format “<Model> <fuelAmount>  <distanceTraveled>”. Print the fuel amount rounded to two decimal places after the separator.

Raw Data
You are the owner of a courier company and want to make a system for tracking your cars and their cargo. Define a class Car that holds information about model, engine, cargo and a collection of exactly 4 tires. The engine, cargo and tire should be separate classes. Create a constructor that receives all information about the Car and creates and initializes its inner components (engine, cargo and tires).
On the first line of input you will receive a number N - the amount of cars you have. On each of the next N lines you will receive information about a car in the format “<Model> <EngineSpeed> <EnginePower> <CargoWeight> <CargoType> <Tire1Pressure> <Tire1Age> <Tire2Pressure> <Tire2Age> <Tire3Pressure> <Tire3Age> <Tire4Pressure> <Tire4Age>” where the speed, power, weight and tire age are integers, tire pressure is a double. 
After the N lines you will receive a single line with one of 2 commands: “fragile” or “flamable”. If the command is “fragile” print all cars whose Cargo Type is “fragile” with a tire whose pressure is  < 1. If the command is “flamable” print all cars whose Cargo Type is “flamable” and have Engine Power > 250. The cars should be printed in order of appearing in the input.

Rectangle Intersection
Create a class Rectangle. It should consist of an id, width, height and the coordinates of its top left corner (horizontal and vertical). Create a method which receives as a parameter another Rectangle, checks if the two rectangles intersect and returns true or false. 
On the first line you will receive the number of rectangles – N and the number of intersection checks – M. On the next N lines, you will get the rectangles with their id, width, height and coordinates. On the last M lines, you will get pairs of ids which represent rectangles. Print if each of the pairs intersect.
You will always receive valid data. There is no need to check if a rectangle exists.

Car Salesman
Define two classes Car and Engine. A Car has a model, engine, weight and color. An Engine has model, power, displacement and efficiency. A Car’s weight and color and its Engine’s displacements and efficiency are optional. 
On the first line you will read a number N which will specify how many lines of engines you will receive. On each of the next N lines you will receive information about an Engine in the following format “<Model> <Power> <Displacement> <Efficiency>”. After the lines with engines, on the next line you will receive a number M – specifying the number of Cars that will follow. On each of the next M lines information about a Car will follow in the format “<Model> <Engine> <Weight> <Color>”, where the engine will be the model of an existing Engine. When creating the object for a Car, you should keep a reference to the real engine in it, instead of just the engine’s model.
Note that the optional properties might be missing from the formats.
Your task is to print each car (in the order you received them) and its information in the format defined bellow, if any of the optional fields has not been given print “n/a” in its place instead:
<CarModel>:
  <EngineModel>:
    Power: <EnginePower>
    Displacement: <EngineDisplacement>
    Efficiency: <EngineEfficiency>
  Weight: <CarWeight>
  Color: <CarColor>
Bonus*
Override the classes’ ToString() methods to have a reusable way of displaying the objects.

Pokemon Trainer
You wanna be the very best pokemon trainer, like no one ever was, so you set out to catch pokemon. Define a class Trainer and a class Pokemon. Trainers have a name, number of badges and a collection of pokemon, Pokemon have a name, an element and health, all values are mandatory. Every Trainer starts with 0 badges.
From the console you will receive an unknown number of lines until you receive the command “Tournament”. Each line will carry information about a pokemon and the trainer who caught it in the format “<TrainerName> <PokemonName> <PokemonElement> <PokemonHealth>” where TrainerName is the name of the Trainer who caught the pokemon. Trainer names are unique.
After receiving the command “Tournament”, an unknown number of lines containing one of the three elements “Fire”, “Water”, “Electricity” will follow until the “End” command is received. For every command you must check if a trainer has at least 1 pokemon with the given element. If he does, he receives 1 badge. Otherwise, all of his pokemon lose 10 health. If a pokemon falls to 0 or less health, he dies and must be deleted from the trainer’s collection.
After the “End” command is received you should print all trainers sorted by the amount of badges they have in descending order (if two trainers have the same amount of badges they should be sorted by order of appearance in the input) in the format “<TrainerName> <Badges> <NumberOfPokemon>”.

Google
Google is always watching you, so it should come as no surprise that they know everything about you (even your pokemon collection). Since you’re really good at writing classes, Google asked you to design a class that can hold all the information they need for people.
From the console you will receive an unkown amount of lines until the command “End” is read. On each of those lines there will be information about a person in one of the following formats:
“<Name> company <companyName> <department> <salary>”  
“<Name> pokemon <pokemonName> <pokemonType>”
“<Name> parents <parentName> <parentBirthday>”
“<Name> children <childName> <childBirthday>”
“<Name> car <carModel> <carSpeed>”
You should structure all information about a person in a class with nested subclasses. People’s names are unique - there won’t be 2 people with the same name. A person can also have only 1 company and car, but can have multiple parents, children and pokemons. After the command “End” is received, on the next line you will receive a single name. You should print all information about that person. Note that information can change during the input - for instance if we receive multiple lines which specify a person’s company, only the last one should be the one remembered. The salary must be formated to two decimal places after the seperator.

Override the ToString() method in the classes to standardize the displaying of objects.
Family Tree
You want to build your family tree, so you went to ask your grandmother. Sadly, your grandmother keeps remembering information about your predecessors in pieces, so it falls to you to group the information and build the family tree.
On the first line of input you will receive either a name or a birthdate in the format “<FirstName> <LastName>” or “day/month/year” – your task is to find the person’s information in the family tree. On the next lines until the command “End” is received you will receive information about your predecessors that you will use to build the family tree. 
The information will be in one of the following formats: 
“FirstName LastName - FirstName LastName”
“FirstName LastName - day/month/year”
“day/month/year - FirstName LastName”
“day/month/year - day/month/year”
“FirstName LastName day/month/year”
The first 4 formats reveal a family tie – the person on the left is parent to the person on the right (as you can see the format does not need to contain names, for example the 4th format means the person born on the left date is parent to the person born on the right date). The last format ties different information together – i.e. the person with that name was born on that date. Names and birthdates are unique – there won’t be 2 people with the same name or birthdate, there will always be enough entries to construct the family tree (all people’s names and birthdates are known and they have atleast one connection to another person in the tree). 
After the command “End” is received you should print all information about the person whose name or birthdate you received on the first line – his name, birthday, parents and children (check the examples for the format). The people in the parents and childrens lists should be ordered by their first appearance in the input (regardless if they appeared as a birthdate or a name, for example in the first input Stamat is before Penka because he has appeared first on the second line, while she appears on the third one).

*Cat Lady
Ginka has many cats of various breeds in her house. Since some breeds have specific characteristics, Ginka needs some way to catalogue the cats. Help her by creating a class hierarchy with all her breeds of cats, so she can easily check on their characteristics. Ginka has 3 specific breeds of cats: “Siamese”, “Cymric” and the very famous bulgarian breed “Street Extraordinaire”. Each breed has a specific characteristic about which information should be kept. For the Siamese cats their ear size should be kept, for Cymric cats - the length of their fur in centimeters and for the Street Extraordinaire - the decibels of their meowing during the night.
From the console you will receive lines of information with cats. Until the command “End” is received, the information will come in one of the following formats:
“Siamese <name> <earSize>”
“Cymric <name> <furLength>”
“StreetExtraordinaire <name> <decibelsOfMeows>”
On the last line after the “End” command you will receive the name of a cat. You should print that cat’s information in the same format in which you received it (with fur size being formated to two decimal places after the separator).
Constraints
Ear size and decibels will always be positive integers
Cat names are unique
Example
Input	Output
StreetExtraordinaire Maca 85
Siamese Sim 4
Cymric Tom 2.80
End
Tom	Cymric Top 2.80
StreetExtraordinaire Koti 80
StreetExtraordinaire Maca 100
Cymric Tim 3.10
End
Maca	StreetExtraordinaire Maca 100
Hint
Use class inheritance to represent the cat hierarchy and override the ToString() methods of concrete breeds to allow for easy printing of the cat, regardless the breed.
*Drawing tool
You are a young programmer and your boss gave you a task to create a tool, which draws figures on the console. He knows you are not too good at OOP tasks, so he told you to create a class - DrawingTool. Its task is to draw rectangular figures on the console.
DrawingTool’s constructor should take as a parameter a Square or a Rectangle object, extract its characteristics and draw the figure. Like we said, your boss is a good guy and he has some more info for you:
One of the extra classes you will need should be a class named Square that should have only one method – Draw() which uses the length of the square’s sides and draws them on the console. For horizontal lines, use dashes ("-") and spaces (" "). For vertical lines – pipes ("|"). If the size of the figure is 6, the dashes should also be 6. 
Hint
Search in the internet for abstract classes and try implementing one. This will help you to reduce the input parameters in the DrawingTool’s constructor to one.
Examples
Input	Output	Comment
Square
3	|---|
|   |
|---|	Square’s size is 3 so we draw 3 pipes down and 3 dashes across
